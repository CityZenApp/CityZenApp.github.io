<h3>CityZen app</h3>
<p>After announcing to the local hackerspace members first, we would like to share the exciting news about the launch of CityZen app here at our blog as well. We are using the word 'exciting' as this is an open source project not based on 'the start-up silicon valley strusture' cities so it has a chance of becoming mainstream. We would like to share some context before presenting the project.</p>
<p>Today, city-navigation or Points Of Interest (POIs) apps are exactly what their name says: they are supposed to help you get around in the spots of the city you are at the moment. If you like to find points of interest (POIs) easy on the cities you visit, probably you need a guide or somehow orientation where to start. This becomes even more important when you are traveling, because you are probably searching for something very specific first. Your secondary need is to go from your location to that specific POI you are interested in. For example, if you are searching for a bank, you probably need the one that is closer to you and that is opened at a certain time right? After finding the bank that is opened at the time that is convenient to you you, will probably need to use a navigator to go there.</p>
