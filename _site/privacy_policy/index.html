<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At CityZenApp we have a few fundamental principles:
<ul><li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li.
<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.</li>

From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>cityzenapp.co also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Ctyzenapp.co only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
