# CityZenApp.github.io
CityZen is an OpenStreetMap based application that shows points of interest in a map. Features are divided into categories to make search easier. CityZen has a focus on privacy and it does not track you.

This repository is dedicated to the website for the project, which for the moment is running at cityzenapp.github.io. We chose to develop the website through GitHub to give an opportunity to contributors who want to get involved, to make  Pull Requests or to open issues.
