		<h2>The companion app to navigate the city
		<br />
		open source & privacy by default</h2>
		<p>CityZen is an open source Android app that helps you navigate and explore your city easily. With CityZen you find points of interest (POIs) such as ATMs, gas stations, drugstores, mobile phone stores and other interesting services near you. The app shows these POIs based on your location of your smartphone, but it does so by respecting your privacy since we don’t keep your navigation data.
The app is licensed in an open source because we want to engage as many people as possible in improving the app. It is also a way of respecting tools and platforms such as OpenStreetMap that respect our freedoms.
If you are an OpenStreetMap contributor you can easily add information to the POIs by editing them inside CityZen.<br />
Made with love from Tirana ♥</p>
